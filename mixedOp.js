var first='Mobarok';
var second='Tobarok';

var fullName=first+second;
console.log(fullName);
console.log('40'+2);//output:402
console.log(40-'30');//output:10
console.log(4*'2');//output:8
console.log(10/'5');//output:2
console.log(13/'2');//output:6.5
// Note: It seems only on the case of addition if one variable is number other is string then output is both side by side
//All the other arithmetic operation do just fine as long as the string is number , I think it automatically parse the string into respective number and do the arithmetic operation and show the output in output console
